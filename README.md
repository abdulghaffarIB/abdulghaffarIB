I'm Abdulghaffar, a Junior Frontend and Mobile app developer based in Nigeria. Dedicated to creating intuitive user experiences and bringing ideas to life, I thrive in the dynamic world of web and mobile development.

💻 With expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Next.js and React, I specialize in building responsive web applications with pixel-perfect designs.

📱 Additionally, my proficiency in React Native enables me to develop sleek and performant mobile apps.

🎨 I leverage tools like Tailwind CSS, Styled-components and CSS Preprocessors for efficient styling and rapid prototype designs, aiming to exceed expectations in every project.

🚀 In every project I undertake, my goal is to not only meet but exceed expectations. I'm committed to delivering high-quality solutions that not only look great but also perform seamlessly across devices and platforms.

🌍 Beyond coding, I'm driven by technology's potential for positive change and eager to contribute to impactful projects.
